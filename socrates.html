	<p> Socrates was the first Greek philosopher. He taught Plato and made up the Socratic method. He's really famous for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Socrates" target="_blank""> his trials. </a> He was always looking for ways to make loopholes in the laws of how stuff should work. This made it so that people could understand the fuller meaning of why something was "true" or not. </p>
