<p> Aristole followed the Socratic method. He hung out with Plato, they hung out in Greece. He also taught Alexander the Great. He probably competed to be the most famous Greek philosopher, although Plato probably won. His style of teaching involved walking around (which we'll probably do in the philosophy club), because he thought that was a better way to learn than sitting down. He founded the <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/lyceum" target="_blank">Lyceum </a> and also the <a href="https://oxfordre.com/classics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-4870" target="_blank">Peripatetic approach to learning.</a> </p>
